The Explosive Prop class is an abstract base class for explosive props in Unreal Engine. It inherits from AA_Prop and includes properties for defining explosion parameters through the FExplosionParams struct. The class overrides the OnDeath function to handle the explosive effect when the prop is destroyed, spawning an AA_Explosion actor and triggering the explosion with specified parameters.
