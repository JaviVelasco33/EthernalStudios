The AA_Barrier class represents a barrier actor in Unreal Engine 4, designed to block or allow actors based on various configurable properties. This barrier can be animated using a timeline, enabling smooth transitions between active and inactive states. The class provides methods to activate or deactivate the barrier and manage its behavior through Blueprint functions. Key features include customizable meshes, material properties, barrier size, and the ability to control which actors can pass through the barrier. The barrier is visually represented by static meshes and can dynamically adjust its scale and visibility based on gameplay conditions.
